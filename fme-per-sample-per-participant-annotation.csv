That is not how film music works, because it needs to tie into the both the visuals and the story. Feeling isn't a score.That said, this approach with AI might be profitable as an app to generate background music for people who don't know anything about music or film. Energetic and positive cat videos, or maybe slow and sad 'This is how it feels to lose your boyfriend' instagram posts.

Interesting and worthy of a study and experiment, but allow me to paraphrase David Lynch talking about watching films on a phone, to explain what I think the result is:

If you're scoring music with AI, you will never in a trillion years merge the music into the film. You'll think you have done it, but you'll be cheated.
